Hello!  

I am currently a Data Scientist working in Government Consulting, with more than three years of hands-on analytics experience. At work, I am an avid developer and problem solver, primarily focused on data analytics and data science projects in the national security and intelligence sectors. I most recently completed a Data Analytics MicroMasters program through the **[Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/gtx-analytics-essential-tools-and-methods)**.

I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the **Rutgers University** SAS Honors Program, with a double major in Mathematics and Political Science, and a minor in Spanish. I have always desired to utilize my Mathematics and data analytics experience in the public sector. Since I started consulting Federal agencies on data analytics, data management, predictive modeling, and data science projects, my eyes have opened to the world of data science and its applications in Government. I primarily use my experience in SQL to wrangle and pull the data I'm interested in, then clean and analyze the data in *R, Python, Excel (VBA), or Access (VBA)*, and finally visualize the results in *Tableau* by building robust, self-service dashboards. 

All the skills I have learned while at work would go to waste if I couldn't share them with the world! And thus, **[Datacracy](https://www.datacracy.us/about/)** was born. As of now, this site uses R programming for analyses, but I'm hoping to showcase my Python and Tableau skills soon!
