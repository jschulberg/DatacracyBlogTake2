Hello!  

I am currently a Senior Data Scientist working in Government Consulting/Contracting, with more than six years of hands-on analytics experience. At work, I am an avid developer and problem solver, primarily focused on data analytics and data science projects in the national security and intelligence sectors. After four long and painstaking years,I most recently completed my Master of Science in Analytics at **[Georgia Institute of Technology](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics)**.

I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the **Rutgers University** SAS Honors Program, with a double major in Mathematics and Political Science, and a minor in Spanish. I have always desired to utilize my Mathematics and data analytics experience in the public sector. Since I started consulting Federal agencies on data analytics, data management, predictive modeling, and data science projects, my eyes have opened to the world of data science and its applications in Government. I primarily use my experience in SQL to wrangle and pull the data I'm interested in, then clean and analyze the data in *R, Python, Excel (VBA), or Access (VBA)*, and finally visualize the results in *Tableau* or *Power BI* by building robust, self-service dashboards. 

All the skills I have learned while at work would go to waste if I couldn't share them with the world! And thus, **[Datacracy](https://www.datacracy.us/about/)** was born. As of now, this site uses R programming for analyses and the site build, but I mainly use Python at work and am slowly building out my Python code on this site.
