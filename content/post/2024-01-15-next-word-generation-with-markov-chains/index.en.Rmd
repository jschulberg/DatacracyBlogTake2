This article leverages some work I did for my grad program's Bayesian Statistics Course. Specifically, it uses Bayesian inference for the task of [*next word prediction*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17184).

# Next Word Prediction
A common task that language models try to solve is next word prediction. Given a series of words in a sentence, can the language model predict the *next* word that should appear? Ideally, the model would use understanding of the prior words that appeared 



## Bayes' Formula
The traditional Bayes' formula, given events A and B, is:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

Given a prior, $\theta$, which represents the probability distribution of a data object *before* it's observed, and a likelihood $y$, which represents the probability of falling under a specific category/class, we can generalize the above formula to compute the posterior as such:

$$
p(\theta|y) = \frac{p(y|\theta)*p(\theta)}{p(y)}
$$

where $p(\theta|y)$ represents the posterior probability: the probability after the evidence from our prior is considered.


## A Simple Application of Bayes for Next Word Prediction
Let's start simple. We'll take some text and tokenize it into words. I'll then create a matrix that shows the probability that a word appears given the word that comes directly before it. Again, this is a naive approach because I will *only* look at the word that comes immediately before. That makes the approach act more like a [Markovian transition matrix](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2584334), since it's just looking at the state immediately before to make a prediction, rather than all the events that led up to the prediction.

Markov chain analysis is a mathematical framework used to model and analyze systems that undergo transitions between different states over time. A Markov chain is a stochastic process where the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. In this case our "state" is the current word being observed. We will use the current state (word) to predict the next state (word).
