*"Speak softly and carry a big script"* -- Teddy Roosevelt -- Justin Schulberg

This site blends public policy, law, government, and politics with analytics. It applies cutting-edge analytical techniques to shine light on public datasets. I use R (and hope to use Python and Tableau) for the vast majority of the posts published on this site. I hope you enjoy it!
