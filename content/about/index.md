*"Speak softly and carry a big script"* -- Teddy Roosevelt -- Justin Schulberg

This site blends public policy, law, government, and politics with analytics. Its purpose is two-fold:

1. Apply cutting-edge analytical techniques to shine light on public datasets. Hopefully this helps with discourse on pressing (and sometimes not-so-pressing) public matters in the U.S.
1. Act as a personal portfolio of the kind of work I do in the analytics realm.

I use R, a bit of Python, and hope to use Tableau/R Shiny for the vast majority of the posts published on this site. I hope you enjoy it!
